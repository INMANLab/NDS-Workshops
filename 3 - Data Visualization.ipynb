Many people, myself included, have a tendency to skim through the text in published academic papers and focus instead on the figures for this reason. A well-designed figure makes your message clear, and facilitates all other aspects of communicating the science.\n","\n","On the flip side, when figures are poorly designed, they prime the reader (whether consciously or subconsciously) to form negative opinions about the work－for example, a mislableled figure with multiple spelling errors suggests that the authors lack an appropriate attention to detail, one which might permeate other aspects of the work. Put differently, it is much better to be remembered for your strengths rather than your weaknesses (as the above portraits illustrate).\n","\n","No amount of time spent giving your figures a facelift is a substitute for conducting well-designed, rigorous research that results in clean data. Garbage in, will inevitably lead to garbage out, no matter how pleasant the color palette. Although much of how data are visualized is a matter of personal preference (and existing conventions in your field), there are certain design principles that will almost certainly help you to better convey your message.  \n","\n","<br>\n","\n","#### Information Density\n","\n","$$\n","\\text{Density}_{\\text{I}} = \\frac{\\text{I}_{\\text{Helpful}} - \\text{I}_{\\text{Unhelpful}}}{\\text{Volume}_{\\text{I}}}\n","$$\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","To be perfectly clear, I've completely made up this equation (but the mathematization does suggest credibility). That being said, the formula captures an essential idea that we'll come back to throughout this notebook: **maximizing the information conveyed by a figure is a function of how much helpful information there is relative to the total volume of information/content provided**. Certain practices universally add helpful information (see the \"Ten Simple Rules\" outlined below).\n","\n","A figure with high information density speaks for itself, is intuitive, and can be understood with little, if any, added explanation.

How to Make Better Figures"],"metadata":{"id":"D4LH4tr9pR2p"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 2.1 Ten Simple Rules for Scientific Data Visualization\n","\n","Below are a set of ten rules adapted from [Rougier et al. 2014](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833) intended to improve figure design and avoid common pitfalls.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RrHtD8kClXTa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### 1. Know Your Audience\n","- Is this a figure for a scientific publication, a data update with your PI, or to show your grandparents what you do? It's important to think about who the intended audience is and tailor the content accordingly. This is particularly true when the audience contains people outside of your field of research; bar plots are universal, but more niche things like spectrograms or tSNE plots might require some extra thought.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","#### 2. Identify Your Message\n","- A figure is meant to express an idea, or a collection of ideas. What is the prupose of including this particular figure? What are you hoping to convey? Once you've clarified the message, the subsequent decisions regarding style and visualization are much more straightforward.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","#### 3. Adapt the Figure to Your Medium\n","- Will this figure be used in a presentation for a large audience, an open-access electronic paper, or printed black and white as a conference proceeding? In many respects, the medium shapes how the content should be presented. As a general rule, it's a good idea to use large font text in presentations (viewed from a distance) and use high-contrast colors which can still be disambiguated if black and white.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","#### 4. Captions Are Not Optional\n","- Don't expect to rely on your ability to verbally explain each aspect of the figure. Remember, great figures speak for themselves. Always include captions that contextualize the work and the major takeaways. Doing so makes it easier for others to share your figures and ideas.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","#### 5. Do Not Trust the Defaults\n","- Any plotting tool you use has some default settings. However, default in no way implies best. Since the defaults are intended for use with every plot, they are rarely the best for any specific application. Take the time to enhance your figure by thinking through how different elements can be tuned to best to convey your message.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","#### 6. Use Color Effectively\n","- Appropriate color selection is absolutely essential for creating great figures. The use of specific colors, or color palettes, has subtle implications－if you're plotting your data on a cool-warm (blue-red) palette, this suggests that values transition fluidly from low to high, with some neutral medium. Consider the properties of the data you are trying to visualize and the goals of the analysis. Avoid changing the colors used for visualizing the same groups across different figures. As a general rule, avoid problematic color pairings (e.g., 5-8% of men, and 0.5-1% of females have red-green color blindness).\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","#### 7. Do Not Mislead the Reader\n","- The major distinction between scientific data visualization and other artistic media are that the content needs to be depicted as objectively as possible. Arbitrarily changing the scale of the data to visually enhance/decrease a difference is misleading. As a general rule, you should hold specific elements constant (x- and y-axis limits) across plots being contrasted to facilitate accurate comparison.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","#### 8. Avoid \"Chartjunk\"\n","- \"Chartjunk\" refers to all of the unhelpful or confusing elements of a figure that distract from the overall message. It's best to avoid unnecessary clutter (e.g., gridlines), unconventional symbols (e.g., diamond markers on a scatterplot) unless you have a compelling reason for doing so. Remove unnecessary backgrounds, redundant labels, etc to maximize information density!\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","#### 9. Message Trumps Beauty\n","- A well-designed figure helps enhance/convey your message, but it's not a substitute for the message itself. Complex, visually-appealing figures are not inherently better than simpler alternatives. In fact, the opposite is often true.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","#### 10. Get the Right Tool(s)\n","- Thankfully, you don't need to reinvent the wheel to design great figures. There are many existing tools which make figure creation and editing easy. We'll review some of the coding libraries below, but I highly recommed other resources like Adobe Illustrator and Biorender (icon library) which can help bring everything together and make your work look professional."],"metadata":{"id":"vD7FfqeWVWnJ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 2.2 General Advice\n","\n","#### 1. Export High-Resolution (vectorized) Figures for Publication\n","- Don't go through all that work to make a beautiful figure only for the quality to be reduced when you export! When possible, use *vectorized* graphic formats (e.g., .pdf, .svg) which don't become blurry when zooming in. Additionally, increase the *dots per inch (DPI)* during export to enhance resolution  (more isn't always better though－doing so will increase file size).  \n","\n","  <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1x1rCRcgjhmDpemaIhzduNqCYXUwjiK_i' width=\"300\">  <img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1S1HON4wK94g2eAIx3k3pzziysAKVtejM' width=\"350\">  \n","<br>\n","\n","#### 2. Write Visualization Code That is Shareable, Reusable, & Versatile\n","- Good data visualization code is reproducible. Great data visualization code is well-documented with comments and a docstring, can be used in different contexts, can be run on other computers, and is easy to follow.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","#### 3. Leverage Existing Knowledge (e.g., ChatGPT)\n","- Don't get bogged down in the technical implementation of how to create your figures.

Everything else is more a matter of personal preference－want to force the plot to show *ticks* at specific locations or remove the framing around figure? The sky is the limit.
